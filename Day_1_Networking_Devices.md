1. NETWORKING DEVICES
What is a network?
A computer network is a way for computers and other devices (called nodes) to connect and share resources like files, printers, or the internet.

Client â†’ A device that asks for and uses a service (like your phone opening a website).

Server â†’ A device that gives services (like a websiteâ€™s computer sending you the page).

ðŸ’¡ Tip: One device can be both a client and a server at the same time in some setups â€” like in a Peer-to-Peer network (e.g., file sharing between two laptops).

SWITCHES (Layer 2 device)
Connect devices inside the same LAN (Local Area Network).

Have many ports for connecting PCs, printers, etc.

Canâ€™t connect different networks or give internet access.

ROUTERS (Layer 3 device)
Connect different networks together (like your home network to the internet).

Usually have fewer ports than switches.

Decide the best path for sending data.

FIREWALLS (Layer 3, 4, or 7 device)
Control what traffic can enter or leave your network.

Can be hardware (separate device) or software (on your PC).

Use rules to allow or block network traffic.

Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) have smarter filtering (like blocking specific apps or detecting threats).
